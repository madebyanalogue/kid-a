Our industry still has deep rooted in manufactuvring in countries hundreds of miles away, with single use or complex plastics and then flown to the destination. This keeps us up at night.</div>

Our small team have created a community of support within music that encompasses all the major UK music organisations and businesses, over 4000 recording artists and a host of important individuals and change makers within UK music culture.<br/><br/>Through the NO MUSIC ON A DEAD PLANET campaign they have shifted the dynamic of climate communications by on-boarding messengers of global impact, from Billie Eilish and Radiohead to the London Symphony Orchestra and Julian Lloyd Webber. By working across the entire music ecosystem, with a presence at grass roots shows and major festivals we are shifting access to climate activism into the mainstream.</div>
